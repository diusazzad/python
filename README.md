# Python Practice Repository

This repository contains my daily practice exercises for Python, covering fundamental concepts to more advanced object-oriented programming.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **Daily_Labs/**: Contains daily practice files from Day 1 to Day 9.
- **Diagram/**: Visual diagrams and UML designs for the labs.
- **Visual_Guides/**: Detailed guides and explanations for concepts.
- **Visual_Traces/**: Step-by-step execution traces of the code.

## 🚀 Daily Labs

| Day | Topic | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| **Day 1** | Memory and Variables | Basic variable assignment and data types. |
| **Day 2** | Neural Logic | Introduction to conditional logic (if/else). |
| **Day 3** | Iterating Data | Working with loops and sequences. |
| **Day 4** | Structured Data | Using lists and dictionaries. |
| **Day 5** | Neural Functions | Defining and using functions. |
| **Day 6** | The AI Toolbox | Using external libraries and APIs. |
| **Day 7** | Class Roots | Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (Classes). |
| **Day 8** | Inheritance | Understanding class inheritance. |
| **Day 9** | Complex OOP | Advanced Object-Oriented Programming concepts. |

## 🎨 Visual Resources

- **Diagrams**: UML diagrams for class structures.
- **Visual Guides**: Markdown explanations of key concepts (e.g., Dictionaries).
- **Visual Traces**: Step-by-step execution flows to understand code behavior.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any of the labs:
1. Navigate to the `Daily_Labs` directory.
2. Open the Python file (e.g., `Day1_Memory_and_Variables.py`).
3. Run it using `python Day1_Memory_and_Variables.py`.
